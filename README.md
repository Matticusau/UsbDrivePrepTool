# USB Drive Preparation Tool (Wipe, Encrypt, Prepare)

**Project Description**
This is a public release of a project I have worked on to assist with the task of preparing a USB drive. If your role is customer facing it is a useful tool to Format, Encrypt, and Prepare a USB drive before each visit. 

Currently the script provides the following functionality:
* Detects attached removable USB drives
* Formats the selected drive
* Encrypts the selected drive with Bitlocker2Go (Password)
* Backs up the Bitlocker key to a specified folder
* Copies the contents of a "common tools" directory
* Customisable with -Setup param to specify Bitlocker Key backup location and Common Tools directory
